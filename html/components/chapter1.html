    <h2>War and Disasters</h2>
    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">
    Eleven years of data. Eleven years that tell a story no single explosion explains. 
    This chapter pulls the Yemen crisis apart—not as a single event, but as interlocking pieces. 
    Two worlds colliding. <br>Look up, and you see the war itself: where it strikes, how it moves,
     how violence spreads like a stain across the map. Look down, and you see everything else.
      Hunger. Cholera. Storms that destroy what's left. Things that aren't weapons but kill
       just as surely. <br>This is the real story: nature doesn't care about ceasefires.
        Disaster doesn't wait for peace. When you combine a failing state with a warzone 
        with forces of nature, something catastrophic emerges. A lethal combination. 
        The numbers prove it. The humanitarian collapse didn't come from one thing. 
        It came from all of them at once.</p>
