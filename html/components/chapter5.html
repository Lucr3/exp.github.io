            While on the ground the crisis has become a tragic constant, global attention has followed a very different rhythm, often disconnected from the humanitarian reality. This chapter shifts the analysis from Yemeni soil to international perception, querying over twenty years of Google Trends data to quantify the world's view of the conflict.
            <br>The following visualizations reveal the intermittent nature of digital empathy. The timeline does not show constant concern, but rather a series of episodic cycles: global interest flares up briefly and then quickly dissipates into silence.
            <br>The frequency histogram provides statistical confirmation of this ‘recurring amnesia’. The distribution of the data highlights how attention to Yemen remains predominantly crushed at minimum values. The data tells an uncomfortable truth: despite the gravity of the situation, for the global web, the Yemeni crisis is not a topic of sustained interest, but only a statistical anomaly in the news flow.
