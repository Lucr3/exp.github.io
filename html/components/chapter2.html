        <h2>The Economic Crisis</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">When the guns fall silent, another battle begins: the battle for daily bread. In this chapter, we shift our gaze from the military fronts to the local markets, where Yemen's economy has imploded under the weight of the conflict. The visualizations that follow chronicle devastating hyperinflation. From a map showing how the cost of living varies dramatically from governorate to governorate, to an analysis of the prices of essential goods—beans, wheat, fuel—we discover how political instability has turned food into a luxury and survival into a daily economic challenge.</p>
