        <h2>The Economic Crisis</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">
            The guns don't feed anyone. What comes after—or alongside—them is something quieter and more relentless: the slow starvation of an economy. This chapter abandons the battlefields for something more intimate. The markets. The places where people try to buy what they need and discover they can't afford it anymore.
            <br>Yemen's economy didn't just fail. It collapsed under the weight of war. Hyperinflation didn't creep in gradually—it devastated everything overnight. A kilo of beans costs what it used to cost for a week's groceries. Wheat. Fuel. The essentials. Everything moved differently depending on where you are. One governorate can feed its families. Another can't. Political breakdown didn't just wreck the state—it weaponized hunger. Food became luxury. Survival became arithmetic you do at the market, calculating if you can afford another meal.</p>
