        <h2>Child Mortality</h2>
        <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">
            The numbers tell something devastating. Yemen's population keeps growing, year after year. More children born. More mouths to feed. But what's waiting for them? Schools that don't work. Hospitals that can't help. Jobs that don't exist. Every baby arrives into a world with fewer resources, weaker institutions, less hope. The math is brutal and simple: too many people fighting over too little. When the systems that hold a society together are already crumbling, you can't add pressure without consequences. A little more strain. A drought. An illness spreading. A bomb. And suddenly the whole thing collapses. It doesn't crack slowly—it breaks fast. War doesn't create the problem; it just finishes what time and neglect already started. The pressure building here isn't abstract. It's real. It's hitting families right now. Every single day.
