    <h2>Education Crisis</h2>
    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">
      Schools close. Teachers stop showing up. Children disappear from classrooms. This is what happens to education when war arrives. But Yemen's story holds something surprising: the system refuses to die completely. Students still try to learn. Teachers still show up. Yet beneath this resilience lies something devastating. Drop-out rates climb relentlessly. Classrooms empty not from bombs but from hunger and the weight of impossible choices. A generation is slipping away. Not killed in combat, but lost to poverty, to the need to work, to schools that crumble. The numbers tell the tale: enrollment dwindles, completion rates stall. But behind those statistics are real teenagers and children whose futures evaporate. Education data isn't just data in Yemen. It's the measure of what's being stolen. An entire generation's potential, dissolving while we count the casualties.
