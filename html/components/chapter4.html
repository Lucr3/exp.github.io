    <h2>Education Crisis</h2>
    <p style="color: var(--text-muted); font-size: 1.1rem; margin-bottom: var(--spacing-lg);">
      The Yemeni educational system serves as a critical case study on the resilience and fragility of institutions
      within contexts of protracted conflict.<br> Analyzing education through data involves mapping not only physical
      access to classrooms but also a nation’s capacity to preserve its intellectual future. Despite the humanitarian
      crisis, data flows demonstrate an unexpected systemic resistance, while simultaneously revealing structural
      bottlenecks and educational attrition (drop-out rates) that threaten to produce a "lost generation." The
      following visualizations explore enrollment density and the efficiency of primary education pathways,
      highlighting how conflict variables have impacted the granularity and continuity of educational services.
