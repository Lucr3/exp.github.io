            This tracks a grim arithmetic: the gap between births and deaths. Birth rates keep climbing—exponentially, relentlessly—even as conflict has ravaged the nation since 2014. The war hasn't reversed this trajectory. Not yet. The numbers suggest something harder still: natural growth will crest during this decade, 2020-2030, before eventually stabilizing only near century's end.
            <br>That widening gap matters profoundly. It represents sustained demographic pressure bearing down on a system already at its breaking point. More mouths to feed. More children needing healthcare. More competition for resources that barely exist. In a country collapsing under systemic crisis, this demographic momentum becomes another burden—one that compounds the suffering, year after year.
