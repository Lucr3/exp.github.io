            There's a long arc here. Child mortality—kids under 15—plummeted from nearly 40% in 1968 to just 4.7% today.
            Years of primary care. Vaccination programs. Infrastructure that actually worked. Progress.
            <br>Then the curve flattens. 2014 arrives. The war begins. And something breaks. Not a collapse, not
            yet—humanitarian work keeps the numbers from rising. But the improvement stops cold. It's as if progress
            itself has hit a wall. What took decades to build now depends on fragile aid pipelines and uncertain access.
            The data whispers what it means: without political stability, without peace, these gains could vanish. The
            progress is hostage. Real, but precarious. One more shock away from unraveling everything that took so long
            to repair.
