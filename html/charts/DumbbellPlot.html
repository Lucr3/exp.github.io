            This visualization analyzes the correlation between the number of births and deaths, highlighting a
            constantly expanding “demographic gap.” The historical pattern shows exponential growth in the birth rate
            which, despite the critical issues surrounding the conflict that began in 2014, does not appear to be
            undergoing any sudden reversals in the short term. The data reveal that natural growth will peak in the
            current decade (2020-2030), with projections indicating that flows will only stabilize towards the end of
            the century. The wide gap between the two variables highlights persistent demographic pressure, a critical
            factor that exacerbates competition for food security and health services in a context of systemic crisis.
