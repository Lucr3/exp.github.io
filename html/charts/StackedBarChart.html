            This visualization analyzes the primary education completion rate at three key temporal intervals (2006,
            2013, 2023), offering a comparative breakdown between the student population that finishes the study cycle
            ("Completed") and those who drop out prematurely ("Incomplete").<br>


            The pattern analysis reveals a seemingly counter-intuitive evolution: between 2006 and 2023, the recorded
            completion percentage rose from 61% to 68%. Although this 7-percentage-point increase suggests an
            improvement in the system's internal efficiency, the estimated "drop-off" variable must be carefully
            observed, as it still stands at 32% in 2023.
            <br> From an analytical perspective, this indicates that nearly
            one-third of the school-age population fails to overcome the barrier of primary education. The persistence
            of such a high incompleteness rate, despite the positive trend, highlights a correlation with socio-economic
            barriers induced by the conflict: the demand for child labor and the degradation of school infrastructure
            act as noise variables in the learning process.
