            Three snapshots across seventeen years. 2006, 2013, 2023. Each shows how many kids finish primary school versus how many give up. The headline looks good: 61% completion in 2006 climbs to 68% by 2023. Seven points up. Progress.
            <br>But read the other column. 32% still don't make it. That's almost one in three. A third of Yemen's children never cross the finish line of primary education. A number that sits stubbornly high despite everything improving. Why? The numbers hide the real barriers. Kids leave school because they have to work. Because schools are falling apart. Because families can't afford to keep them there. The conflict twisted everything. It created the conditions where even a system that's technically improving still fails to reach its own kids. Progress and stagnation side by side.
