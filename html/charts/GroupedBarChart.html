            This grouped bar chart illustrates the distribution of the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) broken down by the
            three primary levels of the educational system: primary (blue), secondary (orange), and tertiary (purple).
            The historical series identifies the "inverted pyramid" configuration of Yemeni education and the drastic
            reduction in student density as the level of education progresses.<br>

            The data highlights a peak in primary sector enrollments around 2013, with values exceeding 80%, followed by
            a sharp decline during the transition to the secondary level, which averages around 40%. The tertiary
            variable remains consistently marginal, rarely crossing the 10% threshold. From a technical standpoint,
            significant "data sparsity" is observed in the post-2013 period: the absence of consistent readings for 2014
            and 2015, followed by a general contraction in 2016 (where primary enrollment falls below 80%), serves as a
            direct indicator of how the armed conflict has compromised national statistical monitoring systems and
            service continuity. This "educational attrition" phenomenon suggests that the system fails to convert
            primary literacy into specialized skills, drastically limiting the prospects for human capital development.
