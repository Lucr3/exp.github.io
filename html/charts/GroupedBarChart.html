            The numbers tell a story of a system collapsing from the ground up. Primary education (blue) peaks around 2013 at over 80%, but the moment students advance? The drop is brutal. Secondary (orange) holds barely 40%. Tertiary (purple) barely registers—almost never breaking 10%.
            <br>This is Yemen's inverted pyramid. Each step up the educational ladder, fewer students remain. But there's more. After 2013, the data simply vanishes. 2014 and 2015 have almost nothing. By 2016, primary enrollment falls below 80% for the first time. The conflict didn't just disrupt schools—it broke the ability to track what's happening. The system can't follow its own students. Those who do finish primary? They rarely develop real skills. Knowledge goes nowhere. Futures narrow. Human potential simply evaporates.
